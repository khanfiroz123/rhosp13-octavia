# NOTE: This file is deprecated, and is included for backwards-compatibility
# for use in upgrades. For new deployments, set ipv6: true for isolated
# networks using IPv6 (Tenant network should use IPv4 for tunneling),
# and set the default_route_networks to "['ControlPlane', 'External']"
# on the Controller role to use ControlPlane for IPv4 and External for IPv6
# default routes, and include network-environment.yaml instead of this file.
